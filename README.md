# exercising-for-masochists
## REQUIREMENTS:
1. fast computer (because frames need to be compared faast)
2. webcam (not used by anything else)
3. encouragement device (high voltage transformer, arduino, relay, and some wires)
## IMPORTANT:
Make sure to install the [Dependencies](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) for PyAudio and PortAudio. This ensures the scream detection will work, so that if you need the encouragement to stop, you can do so remotely.<br>
Read the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD before using the code in a development environment, please!<br>
Make sure to change the `scream_mult` in the `main.py` file depending on how sensitive your mic is. The more sensitive, the lower the `scream_mult`, and vice versa. The screaming may not work on every device due to the vast differences between devices and their microphones.
